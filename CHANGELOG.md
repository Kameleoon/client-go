# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 3.12.0 - 2025-05-26
### Features
* Added support for **304 (Not Modified)** responses from the SDK config service to avoid redundant updates and reduce traffic when the configuration hasn't changed.
* Added support for a **New**/**Returning** visitor breakdown filter in reports (requires calling [`GetRemoteVisitorData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getremotevisitordata)).
### Fixed
* Fixed an issue where visitor data fields - [`Browser`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#browser), [`Device`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#device), and [`OperatingSystem`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#operatingsystem) - were all retrieved from the Data API and added to the visitor, even when only a subset of them was requested.

## 3.11.1 - 2025-04-08
### Bug fixes
* Changed the order in which **conversion** and **experiment** events are sent. This may lead to more accurate **visit**-level experiment reporting.

## 3.11.0 - 2025-03-24
### Features
* Added new variation of the [`TrackConversion`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#trackconversion) method:
  - `TrackConversionWithOptParams(visitorCode string, goalId int, params TrackConversionOptParams) error`
* Added new variation of the [`Conversion`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#conversion) data constructor:
  - `NewConversionWithOptParams(goalId int, params ConversionOptParams) *Conversion`

## 3.10.0 - 2025-03-18
### Features
* Added support for Contextual Bandit evaluations. Calling [`GetRemoteVisitorData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getremotevisitordata) with the `cbs=true` flag is required for this feature to function correctly. Platform-wide release expected in March 2025.
* Added new configuration parameter `NetworkDomain` (`network_domain`) to [`KameleoonClientConfig`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#create) and the [configuration](https://developers.kameleoon.com/go-sdk.html#additional-configuration) file. This parameter allows specifying a custom domain for all outgoing network requests.
* Added support for new conditions:
    - Exclusive Campaign
    - Experiment
    - Personalization

## 3.9.0 - 2025-02-26
### Features
* Added SDK support for **Mutually Exclusive Groups**. When feature flags are grouped into a **Mutually Exclusive Group**, only one flag in the group will be evaluated at a time. All other flags in the group will automatically return their default variation.

## 3.8.0 - 2025-02-10
### Features
* Added SDK support for **holdout experiments**. Visitors assigned to a holdout experiment are excluded from all other rollouts and experiments, and consistently receive the default variation. For visitors not in a holdout experiment, the standard evaluation process applies, allowing them to be evaluated for all feature flags as usual. Platform-wide release expected in February 2025.
### Bug fixes
* Fixed an issue in the [`GetActiveFeatureListForVisitor`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getactivefeaturelistforvisitor) method where feature flags disabled for the environment were not being filtered out.

## 3.7.0 - 2024-12-16
### Features
* Added support for **simulated** variations.
* Added the [`SetForcedVariation()`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#setforcedvariation) method. This method allows explicitly setting a forced variation for a visitor, which will be applied during experiment evaluation.
### Bug fixes
* Fixed the [`Variation.IsActive()`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#variation) method, which was returning an incorrect value.
* Fixed an issue where the return values in the trace logs for the following methods of the `kameleoonClient` were always default:
  - `IsFeatureActive`
  - `IsFeatureActiveWithTracking`
  - `isFeatureActive`
  - `GetVariation`
  - `GetVariations`
  - `makeExternalVariation`

## 3.6.1 - 2024-11-20
### Bug fixes
* Resolved an issue where the validation of [top-level domains](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#additional-configuration) for `localhost` resulted in incorrect failures. The SDK now accepts the provided domain without modification if it is deemed invalid and logs an [error](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#log-levels) to notify you of any issues with the specified domain.

## 3.6.0 - 2024-11-14
### Features
* Introduced a new `VisitorCode` parameter to [`RemoteVisitorDataFilter`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#using-parameters-in-getremotevisitordata). This parameter determines whether to use the `VisitorCode` from the most recent previous visit instead of the current `VisitorCode`. When enabled, this feature allows visitor exposure to be based on the retrieved `VisitorCode`, facilitating [cross-device reconciliation](https://developers.kameleoon.com/core-concepts/cross-device-experimentation/). Default value of the parameter is `true`.
### Bug fixes
* Fixed an issue with the [`Page URL`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/using-visit-history-in-feature-flags-and-experiments/#benefits-of-calling-getremotevisitordata) and [`Page Title`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/using-visit-history-in-feature-flags-and-experiments/#benefits-of-calling-getremotevisitordata) targeting conditions, where the condition evaluated all previously visited URLs in the session instead of only the current URL, corresponding to the latest added [`PageView`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#pageview).
**NOTE**: This change may impact your existing targeting. Please review your targeting conditions to ensure accuracy.

## 3.5.0 - 2024-10-04
### Features
* Introduced new evaluation methods for clarity and improved efficiency when working with the SDK:
  - [`GetVariation`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#getvariation)
  - [`GetVariations`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#getvariations)
* These methods replace the deprecated ones:
  - [`GetFeatureVariationKey`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getfeaturevariationkey)
  - [`GetFeatureVariable`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getfeaturevariable)
  - [`GetActiveFeatures`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getactivefeatures)
  - [`GetFeatureVariationVariables`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getfeaturevariationvariables)
* A new method [`IsFeatureActiveWithTracking`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#isfeatureactive--isfeatureactivewithtracking) includes the `track` parameter, which controls whether the assigned variation is tracked.
* Enhanced top-level domain validation within the SDK. The implementation now includes automatic trimming of extraneous symbols and provides a [warning](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#log-levels) when an invalid domain is detected.
* Enhanced the [`GetEngineTrackingCode`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getenginetrackingcode) method to properly handle `JS` and `CSS` variables.
### Bug fixes
* Fixed returning the error when creating a new client was unsuccessful

## 3.4.0 - 2024-08-15
### Features
* Improved the tracking mechanism to consolidate multiple visitors into a single request. The new approach combines information on all affected visitors into one request, which is sent once per interval.
  - Flush changes:
    - The [`FlushVisitor`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#flushall--flushvisitor--flushvisitorinstantly) now enqueues the visitor's data to be tracked with next tracking interval.
    - Added a new [`FlushVisitorInstantly`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#flushall--flushvisitor--flushvisitorinstantly) method which tracks the visitor's data instantly.
    - Added a new parameter `instant` of the [`FlushAll`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#flushall--flushvisitor--flushvisitorinstantly) method. If the parameter's value is `true` the visitor's data is tracked instantly. Otherwise, the visitor's data will be tracked with next tracking interval. Default value of the parameter is `false`.
* Added new configuration parameter `TrackingInterval` (`tracking_interval`) to [`KameleoonClientConfig`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/go-sdk.html#initializing-the-kameleoon-client) and the [configuration](https://developers.kameleoon.com/go-sdk.html#additional-configuration) file, which is used to set interval for tracking requests. Default value is `1000` milliseconds.
* New Kameleoon Data type [`UniqueIdentifier`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/csharp-sdk#uniqueidentifier) is introduced. It will be used in all methods instead of `isUniqueIdentifier` parameter.
  - The `isUniqueIdentifier` parameter is marked as deprecated for the following methods:
    - [`FlushVisitor`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#flushall--flushvisitor--flushvisitorinstantly)
    - [`TrackConversion`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk/#trackconversion)
    - [`GetFeatureVariationKey`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getfeaturevariationkey)
    - [`GetFeatureVariable`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getfeaturevariable)
    - [`IsFeatureActive`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#isfeatureactive)
  - The [`GetRemoteVisitorDataWithOptParams`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getremotevisitordata) method is deprecated. Please use the [`GetRemoteVisitorDataWithFilter`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getremotevisitordata) method instead.
### Bug fixes
* The SDK no longer logs failed tracking requests to the [Data API](https://developers.kameleoon.com/apis/data-api-rest/all-endpoints/post-visit-events/) when the user agent is identified as a bot (i.e., when the status code is 403).
* Fixed an issue that caused duplicate entries in feature flag results for both anonymous and authorized/identified visitors during data reconciliation. This problem occurred when custom data of type mapping ID was not consistently sent for all sessions.

## 3.3.0 - 2024-06-21
### Features
* Added [`GetActiveFeatures`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/go-sdk.html#getactivefeatures) method. It retrieves information about the active feature flags that are available for a specific visitor code. This method replaces the deprecated [`GetActiveFeatureListForVisitor`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/go-sdk.html#getactivefeaturelistforvisitor) method.
### Bug fixes
* The SDK no longer logs failed tracking requests to the [Data API](https://developers.kameleoon.com/apis/data-api-rest/all-endpoints/post-visit-events/) when the user agent is identified as a bot (i.e., when the status code is 403).

## 3.2.0 - 2024-06-10
### Features
* New targeting conditions are now available (some of them may require [`GetRemoteVisitorData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/go-sdk#getremotevisitordata) pre-loaded data)
